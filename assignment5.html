          <h2>Exhibtions in Chengdu</h2>
          
          <p>The website aims to provide an integrated information platform to facilitate exhibition enthusiasts.
            Generally speaking, users can use the website information browsing function for free, but need to pay for more advanced experiences such as posting blogs and exhibition collections.</p>
            <p>The exhibition information and community is the core part of the website, and the users are expected to engage in these parts smoothly. So usability and A/B tests are conducted mainly related to this two parts.The usability test can provide qualitative responses from 5 users about how they operate the whole process any how they feel about the process and the whole website, while AB test results can provide quantitative responses coming from a broader audience to know their page views and whether they’ll submit the forms.</p>

            <p><b>A/B test:<b>
            In order to let users understand the navigation bar classification more clearly, we changed the exhibition to exhibition information and the exhibition hall to exhibition hall introduction, and used some more convincing syntax, changed the website introduction to become a member, and changed the exhibition information guide to a more interactive what exhibition to see on the weekend?
            The order of the navigation bar has also been slightly adjusted, moving the login to the far right to make it appear more eye-catching.
            These adjustments are made to let users have a better understanding of the navigation and encourage them to click the membership button and explore more about the exhibitions.</p>
            <p>After analyse, I'll make some further improvements in these parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>1. Adjust the width of the map and make it responsive in the mobile version
              </li>
              <li>2. Change the order of blogs to show the newest ones first</li>
              <li>3. Add tags to the exhibitions so users could search them by categories</li>
              <li>Add some introduction to the contribution and blogs</lil>
                <li>4. Add photos upload function for blogs</li>
